\section{Wands \& Feelings}

    \begin{charactersheet}{My name is... \underline{\hspace{4cm}}}
    	You are a new student at a wizarding school of great renown.
%	Some outstanding students excel in  athleticism and grit, others knowledge and intellect, and others still passion and eloquence. 
%	Many are a mixture. 
%	You may distribute a total of three points between {\bf body}, {\bf mind}, and {\bf heart}

	\charactersection{Moves}
		When attempting to cast a spell, perform a feat of athleticism, or influence someone, the gm may call for a roll.
		This is called a 'move.'
		You will roll 2d6 and add your {\bf body}, {\bf mind}, or {\bf heart} modifier, depending on what you are trying to do.
		The GM may apply additional modifiers.
		The result of the roll tells us what happens.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bf On a 10+}: Your move succeeds. You narrate the effects of your move and the GM fills in the blanks.
			\item {\bf On a 7-9}: Your move succeeds, but the GM will provide you with a disadvantage or ugly choice as a consequence.
			\item {\bf On a 6-}: Your move fails. The GM narrates the consequences.
		\end{itemize}

	\charactersection{Spellcasting}
		When you use a spellcasting move, you describe the spell you are attempting to perform. 
		You may use a spell that exists in the lore, or you may describe a new spell.
		You decide whether to cast your spell for {\bf precision} or {\bf power}.
		You and the GM decide what these adjectives mean in context.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bf Precision}: Your magic is elegant and accurate.
			\item {\bf Power}: You magic is forceful and imprecise.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\charactersection{Attributes}
		You have 3 points to distribute amongst your {\bf Body}, {\bf Mind}, and {\bf Heart} scores.
