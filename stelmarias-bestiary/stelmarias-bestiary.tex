\section{Stelmaria's Friends}

What follows are stat blocks for Stelmaria's pacted allies. 
Each such ally is an independent fey spirit with their own values and objectives.
So long as Stelmaria adheres to the terms of their pact, the ally will heed Stelmaria's call.

\begin{quotebox}
	Beware angering your allies! Most consider themselves your equal or even your better.

	\end{monsteraction}
	\monstersection{Actions}
	\begin{monsteraction}[Multiattack]
		Snaak makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.
	\end{monsteraction}
	
	\begin{monsteraction}[Bite]
		\emph{Melee Weapon Attack}: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. \emph{Hit}: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is Grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is Restrained, and the Crocodile can't bite another target.

	\begin{monsteraction}[Release the Storm]
		\emph{Concentration (1 min)}: While submerged in water, Pleath whips up a local storm and gains control over the wind and water in a 60 ft diameter cylinder centered on her. The cylinder counts as difficult terrain, and creatures (other than Pleath and Stelmaria) that begin their turn in the cylinder must make a DC 13 strength save or be slid 10 ft and knocked prone.
	\end{monsteraction}

\end{monsterbox}

\subsubsection{Pact}
Pleath agreed to aid you in return for your future assistance.
Pleath asked for your help to ``release the storm'' when the time comes.

Pleath is currently serving the singer Lobi Thic, but is apparently not domesticated. 
She claims that Thic ``harbors the storm'' and will be of use in the future.

\subsubsection{Opinion of You}
Pleath is reserved in judgement. 
She seems to be trusting you to do the right thing when the time comes.
